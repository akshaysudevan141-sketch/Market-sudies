## 📖 Reading the Dashboard

### Flow Strength Meter
Calculates the **relative aggression** of FII vs DII in absolute flow terms:
- **FII Bar (Red) > 70%** → FIIs are the dominant force
- **FII Sell 80% + DII Buy 20%** → 🚨 Panic sell with little domestic support
- **FII Sell 80% + DII Buy 80%** → ✅ Structural rotation — not a free fall

### FII Streak Counter
Tracks consecutive sessions FII stays on one side:
- **🔴 Sell Streak 10+ days** at ₹5,000+ Cr/day = historically extreme oversold 
- **🟢 Buy Streak 5+ days** = strong confirmation of trend reversal / FII re-entry
- **Streak Velocity** = cumulative ₹ Cr damage or firepower during that streak

### Heatmap Color Scale
| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Deep Red | Extreme FII dump (>80% of max) |
| 🟠 Mid Red | Heavy selling |
| 🟡 Light Red | Light net selling |
| 🟢 Light Green | Light net buying |
| 💚 Deep Green | Heavy accumulation |

### Smart Filters (Daily Matrix)
| Filter | Trigger |
|---|---|
| **All Data** | Every session in archive |
| **FII Bloodbath** | FII net sold > ₹5,000 Cr |
| **DII Absorption** | DII net bought > ₹5,000 Cr |
| **Extreme Divergence** | FII sold ≥ ₹8,000 Cr AND DII bought ≥ ₹8,000 Cr |
